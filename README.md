# Splunk Log Collection and Security Event Detection in a Virtual Lab

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates the process of **centralized log collection, real-time monitoring, and security event detection** using **Splunk Enterprise** and **Suricata IDS** in a virtual lab environment.  
It showcases how multiple attack scenarios can be detected and analyzed through integrated SIEM and IDS capabilities.

---

## ðŸ›  Lab Setup
- **Host Machine**: Windows 10 Pro running Splunk Enterprise
- **Monitored Endpoint**: Ubuntu 24 VM with Splunk Universal Forwarder & Suricata IDS
- **Attacker Machine**: Parrot Security OS VM
- **Network**: VirtualBox Bridge adapter configuration

---

## ðŸš¨ Attack Scenarios Simulated
1. **Port Scanning** â€“ Nmap  
2. **SSH Brute Force** â€“ Multiple failed login attempts  
3. **Web Application Attacks** â€“ XSS & SQL Injection payloads  
4. **DDoS Simulation** â€“ UDP Flood via LOIC  

---

## ðŸ“Š Detection & Analysis
- **Windows Event Logs**: Collected locally from the host machine.
- **Ubuntu Logs**: Authentication, kernel, and syslog forwarded to Splunk.
- **Suricata Alerts**: Network-level detection of suspicious traffic.
